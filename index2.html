          Red Velvet (Korean: 레드벨벳; RR: Redeubelbet) is a South Korean girl
          group formed and managed by SM Entertainment. Originally debuted on
          August 1, 2014 with the single "Happiness" with the four-member
          line-up of <span class="irene">Irene</span>,
          <span class="seulgi">Seulgi</span>,
          <span class="wendy">Wendy</span> and <span class="joy">Joy</span>. A
          fifth member, <span class="yeri">Yeri</span>, joined the group in
          March 2015, following the release of first mini album, Ice Cream Cake.
          Musically, the work of Red Velvet reflects their own group name: their
          predominantly-pop "red" side experiments occasionally with electronic,
          funk and hip hop, while their "velvet" side focuses on '90s-influenced
          R&B with elements of ballad and jazz. Their genre versatility and
          hooks have garnered critical praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their wide domestic influence has been recognized by Forbes Korea
          Power Celebrity (placing 11th in 2018 and fifth in 2019)
          Internationally, they were named one of the most popular K-pop groups
          by Time and Billboard and are the fifth most streamed K-pop artist
          worldwide on Spotify as of February 2020. In November 2019, Billboard
          crowned Red Velvet as "the best idol group alive" and named "Red
          Flavor" as the second-best K-pop song of the 2010s.
